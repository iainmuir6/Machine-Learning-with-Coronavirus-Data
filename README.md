# Machine Learning with Coronavirus Data

## Description
Completed during a four-week Independent Study taken through the Computer Science department at the University of Virginia; worked as a research assitant for [Professor Haiying Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/haiying-shen).

Project aims to test the performance of various Machine and Deep Learning algorithms in predicting the result of a Coronavirus-19 test. The entirety of the project was completed in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks. In total, six algorithms were tested, three from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and the other three from [Keras](https://keras.io/); proper citations for these libraries are listed below. The final list of algoritms is as follows:
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Deep Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Netowrk

A final report detailing model performance and research procedure was completed, but it is not included in the repository.
